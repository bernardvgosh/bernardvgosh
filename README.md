I have over 20 years of experience in Software Development, leading and managing projects as a business owner. Now, I'm transitioning to a more technical role, diving deep into the world of development and engineering. I'm passionate about designing robust software solutions and leveraging cutting-edge technologies to solve complex problems. My focus has been on building scalable systems, improving development processes, and delivering high-quality products. I'm eager to continue growing as a Software Engineer, contributing to open-source projects, and sharing my technical expertise.
